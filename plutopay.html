        <h2>Pluto-Pay</h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned Pluto-Pay was a project I completed for CareerFoundry
          during August-October 2022. It served as my first UX project, so it
          was as much a learning journey as it was a design one. <br>Role:
          Sole UX and UI designer. <br>Time frame: 3 months.

              <h2>Research</h2>
              <p>
                Research for Pluto-Pay involved competitive analysis of apps
                such as Paypal, as well as user interviews. From that research,
                I crafted the hypothesis that there are so many different types
                of finance apps currently available, that having functionality
                of multiple apps in one package would offer users enough of a
                convenience.

              <h2>Ideation</h2>
              <p>
                With that hypothesis, and the research in mind, I crafted two
                personas to represent the major conceit of the app moving
                forward. That the app should have the functionalities of both a
                financial tracking app, and a regular banking app in one; and
                that each of these processes should be easy, fast, and secure to
                complete. The user flows I created reflect this as well,
                highlighting the importance of having both an easy way to add
                and transfer to new contacts, and robust financial tracking
                capabilities.

              <h2>Wire frames</h2>
              <p>
                I’ve included these early wire frames because they provide a lot
                of contrast to how I initially imagined Pluto-Pay would look,
                versus how it ended up looking once I had a better grasp of
                design principles. While the overall skeleton of the website
                remains the same, much of the layout and design would change
                over subsequent iterations.

              <h2>Iterations</h2>
              <p>
                Here you can see how the final design of the prototype improved
                with each iteration. This involved a lot of feedback from both
                mentors and peers. Which compelled me to completely redesign the
                initial prototype into the final version you can see on the
                right. The original prototype was over-designed and cluttered,
                mostly due to the fact that I wasn’t confident in my design
                skills at the time. However, you can see the drastic
                improvements made to the final prototype; thanks largely to
                extensive feedback and honed design skills.

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                As my first design project, Pluto-Pay saw the most drastic
                changes during its lifetime. As I picked up more skills, and
                learnt more about general design standards, each iteration
                improved pretty dramatically. It also taught me the full range
                of UX designer skills that I would employ in all future
                projects. I think looking back on the Pluto-Pay project is most
                interesting for me, as you can see the tangible progress I make
                after each step.
